         <h1>Z-Wave.Me Zniffer and Advanced Radio Toolkit (A.R.T.)</h1>
         <p>Version 0.2b3</p>
         <p>Advanced Radio Toolkit (A.R.T.) &mdash; this is a software and hardware complex designed to listen to the radio broadcast of the wireless Z-Wave protocol, compose and send any packets.</p>
         <p>Monitoring radio commands allows you to identify problems in the Z-Wave network, such as incorrect routes, associations with non-existent devices, incorrect packet, and much more.</p>
         <p>Composing and sending packages will be useful for advanced installers and developers of Z-Wave devices to check regular and abnormal situations.</p>
         <p>Z-Uno or RaZberry with a Z-Wave chip of the 7th generation and higher is used as equipment for listening and sending radio commands. The A.R.T. can work simultaneously with several equipment, in this case, you can observe the signal strength of one device from different locations at the same time.</p>
         <p>In order for the equipment to be supported by the software, it is necessary to purchase a license.</p>

         <h3 id="Devices">Devices</h3>
         <p>Ð¡onnect the equipment to the computer, press &quot;+&quot; to add it to the devices list and select the serial port, if selected correctly, the equipment UUID will be displayed.</p>
         <img src="pics/Devices.png" width="80%">
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> &mdash; The name of the equipment (Z-Uno, RaZberry) that listens to the radio broadcast, is displayed in the Trace window, can be edited.</li>
            <li><strong>Serial</strong> &mdash; Device port. Local ports and remote ports with a web serial address are supported.</li>
            <li><strong>Protocol</strong> &mdash; Protocol for equipment interaction with the A.R.T application (Modem &mdash; special mode with the ability to monitor and send packets, PTI &mdash; Z-Uno/RaZberry continues to work in normal mode and report all incoming packets).</li>
            <li><strong>Baudrate</strong> &mdash; Serial port speed. For PTI, it is selected manually (for RaZberry 7 always 230400, for Z-Uno 2 by default 230400 and should match the speed in <a href="https://z-uno.z-wave.me/Reference/zunoPTIConfigUART/?zunoVersion=v2">zunoPTIConfigUART</a> function). For Modem, it is detected automatically.</li>
            <li><strong>Region</strong> &mdash; The radio frequency on which the equipment listens to the radio broadcast. For PTI the current frequency of the equipment is used.</li>
            <li><strong>TX Power</strong> &mdash; The radiation power of the modem is 0.1 dBm. Not available for PTI mode. For Modem it is possible to set a value from 0 to 200, i.e. from 0 to 20 dBm.</li>
